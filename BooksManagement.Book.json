In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506026635i/35133922.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Adult", "Autobiography", "Religion", "Audiobook", "Family", "Book Club", "Biography", "Memoir"], "publisher": "Random House", "series": null, "author": ["Tara Westover"], "publishDate": "20-02-2018", "numOfRating": 108045, "numPages": 352, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.5, "slug": "educated", "totalNum": 75, "currentNum": 73, "totalBorrow": 2, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f1"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Phuong's Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62e8f"}, "title": "The Nightingale", "description": "In love we find out who we want to be.In war we find out who we are.FRANCE, 1939In the quiet village of Carriveau, Vianne Mauriac says good-bye to her husband, Antoine, as he heads for the Front.

Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another.

They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food\u2014and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey.

Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect?Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing.

In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration.

With humor and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage.

Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells\u2014taken without her knowledge\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \u201cimmortal\u201d human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\u2019d weigh more than 50 million metric tons\u2014as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\u2019s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \u201ccolored\u201d ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\u2019s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia \u2014 a land of wooden quarters for enslaved people, faith healings, and voodoo \u2014 to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta\u2019s family did not learn of her \u201cimmortality\u201d until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family \u2014 past and present \u2014 is inextricably connected to the history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\u2014especially Henrietta\u2019s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\u2019s cells.

Kuang comes Babel, a historical fantasy epic that grapples with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of language and translation as the dominating tool of the British EmpireTraduttore, traditore: An act of translation is always an act of betrayal.1828. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he\u2019ll enroll in Oxford University\u2019s prestigious Royal Institute of Translation\u2014also known as Babel. The tower and its students are the world's center for translation and, more importantly, magic. Silver-working\u2014the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars\u2014has made the British unparalleled in power, as the arcane craft serves the Empire's quest for colonization.For Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide . . .Can powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1677361825i/57945316.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Adult", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Historical Fantasy", "Historical Fiction", "Audiobook", "Urban Fantasy", "Magical Realism"], "publisher": "Harper Voyager", "series": null, "author": ["R.F.

At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are.

The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his \"World's Fair Hotel\" just west of the fairgrounds\u2014a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B.

Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. Homegoing is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448108591i/27071490.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Africa", "Historical", "Adult", "Race", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Audiobook", "Book Club", "Ghana"], "publisher": "Alfred A.

Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659905828i/7235533.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Adult", "Fantasy", "High Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Epic", "Adventure", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Magic"], "publisher": "Tor Books", "series": ["The Stormlight Archive", "The Cosmere"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"], "publishDate": "31-08-2010", "numOfRating": 35005, "numPages": 1007, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.7, "slug": "the-way-of-kings", "totalNum": 60, "currentNum": 46, "totalBorrow": 14, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f3"}, "libraryName": "VMT Central Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f59"}, "title": "It's Not Summer Without You", "description": "Belly finds out what comes after falling in love in this follow-up to The Summer I Turned Pretty from the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before (soon to be a major motion picture!), Jenny Han.Can summer be truly summer without Cousins Beach?It used to be that Belly counted the days until summer, until she was back at Cousins Beach with Conrad and Jeremiah.

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than\u00a0forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.\u2019s grandparents were \u201cdirt poor and in love,\u201d and moved north from Kentucky\u2019s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life,\u00a0never\u00a0fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances. In this last remnant of the Wild West\u2014where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, \u201cthe Phantom Terror,\u201d roamed \u2013 virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of the organization\u2019s first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then notoriously corrupt and initially bungled the case. Eventually the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only Native American agents in the bureau. They infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest modern techniques of detection. Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most sinister conspiracies in American history.In Killers of the Flower Moon, David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. The book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward Native Americans that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. Killers of the Flower Moon is utterly riveting, but also emotionally devastating.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1470699853i/29496076.jpg", "genres": ["Mystery", "Nonfiction", "History", "True Crime", "Historical", "Crime", "American History", "Adult", "Audiobook", "Book Club"], "publisher": "Doubleday", "series": null, "author": ["David Grann"], "publishDate": "18-04-2017", "numOfRating": 33744, "numPages": 359, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.1, "slug": "killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi", "totalNum": 52, "currentNum": 11, "totalBorrow": 41, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f4"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Anh Tu Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f64"}, "title": "Cress", "description": "In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with Scarlet and Wolf in tow.

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood--where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned--Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor--engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar's first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city's placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.Like the protagonist of Gulliver's Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey--hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre-Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman's ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362i/30555488.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Adult Fiction", "Historical", "Adult", "Race", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "African American", "Audiobook", "Novels"], "publisher": "Doubleday", "series": null, "author": ["Colson Whitehead"], "publishDate": "02-08-2016", "numOfRating": 31765, "numPages": 320, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.1, "slug": "the-underground-railroad", "totalNum": 87, "currentNum": 76, "totalBorrow": 11, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f3"}, "libraryName": "VMT Central Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f72"}, "title": "What Alice Forgot", "description": "Alice Love is twenty-nine, crazy about her husband, and pregnant with her first child.So imagine Alice\u2019s surprise when she comes to on the floor of a gym and is whisked off to the hospital where she discovers the honeymoon is truly over \u2014 she\u2019s getting divorced, she has three kids and she\u2019s actually 39 years old.

Then, to her amazement, the \u201ccoolest girl in the world\u201d moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\u2019s end they\u2019ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.So begins Kristin Hannah\u2019s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.\u00a0Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\u2019t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she\u2019ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\u2019ll envy her famous best friend. . . .For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\u2019ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone\u2019s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\u2019s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\u2019s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you\u2019ll never forget . . . one you\u2019ll want to pass on to your best friend.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362435448i/1472878.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction", "Adult", "Drama", "Historical Fiction", "Audiobook", "Book Club", "Chick Lit", "Romance"], "publisher": "St. Martin's Press", "series": ["Firefly Lane"], "author": ["Kristin Hannah"], "publishDate": "05-02-2008", "numOfRating": 29675, "numPages": 479, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.2, "slug": "firefly-lane", "totalNum": 38, "currentNum": 36, "totalBorrow": 2, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f5"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen's Books Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f88"}, "title": "The Lost Symbol", "description": "WHAT IS LOST...WILL BE FOUNDIn this stunning follow-up to the global phenomenon The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown demonstrates once again why he is the world's most popular thriller writer.

Within minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object - artfully encoded with five symbols - is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation...one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist - is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations - all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth.As the world discovered in The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histories, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes. In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent, lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn. The Lost Symbol is exactly what Brown's fans have been waiting for...his most thrilling novel yet.(jacket)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1534070883i/6411961.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Adult", "Crime", "Adventure", "Novels", "Historical Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Suspense"], "publisher": "Doubleday", "series": ["Robert Langdon"], "author": ["Dan       Brown"], "publishDate": "15-09-2009", "numOfRating": 29664, "numPages": 509, "language": "English", "avgRating": 3.7, "slug": "the-lost-symbol", "totalNum": 63, "currentNum": 9, "totalBorrow": 54, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f1"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Phuong's Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f89"}, "title": "Between the World and Me", "description": "\u201cThis is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.\u201d\u00a0In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of \u201crace,\u201d a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men\u2014bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion.

And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? \u00a0Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son\u2014and readers\u2014the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children\u2019s lives were taken as American plunder.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647i/8908.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Dystopia", "Apocalyptic", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Post Apocalyptic", "War", "Audiobook", "Zombies", "Horror"], "publisher": "Crown", "series": ["World War Z"], "author": ["Max Brooks"], "publishDate": "12-09-2006", "numOfRating": 29623, "numPages": 342, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4, "slug": "world-war-z-an-oral-history-of-the-zombie-war", "totalNum": 39, "currentNum": 2, "totalBorrow": 37, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f3"}, "libraryName": "VMT Central Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f8b"}, "title": "The Hero of Ages", "description": "\"Description contains spoilers for previous book in the series\"Who is the Hero of Ages?To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler.

One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients' lives -- a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can't stop hooking up with the wrong guys -- she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell. With startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.Maybe You Should Talk to Someone is revolutionary in its candor, offering a deeply personal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly revealing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547189796i/37570546.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Self Help", "Adult", "Mental Health", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Memoir", "Psychology", "Personal Development"], "publisher": "Harper", "series": null, "author": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "publishDate": "02-04-2019", "numOfRating": 27990, "numPages": 415, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.4, "slug": "maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone", "totalNum": 77, "currentNum": 62, "totalBorrow": 15, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f1"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Phuong's Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62f9d"}, "title": "Norse Mythology", "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 9780393356182Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok.

Kirsch, who was one of Langdon's first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence. As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch's precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch's secret. Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain's Royal Palace itself . . . and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch. On a trail marked by modern art and enigmatic symbols, Langdon and Vidal uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch's shocking discovery . . . and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us.

The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.

Imagine his surprise when he finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the craft of modern sorcery.

Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a literary experience unlike any other\u2014for no one but Saunders could conceive it. February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. \"My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,\" the president says at the time. \"God has called him home.\" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy's body. From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state\u2014called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo\u2014a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul. Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices\u2014living and dead, historical and invented\u2014to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492130850i/29906980.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Literature", "Historical", "Adult", "Fantasy", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "Audiobook", "Magical Realism"], "publisher": "Random House", "series": null, "author": ["George Saunders"], "publishDate": "14-02-2017", "numOfRating": 23907, "numPages": 368, "language": "English", "avgRating": 3.8, "slug": "lincoln-in-the-bardo", "totalNum": 75, "currentNum": 60, "totalBorrow": 15, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f5"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen's Books Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62fd3"}, "title": "Thunderhead", "description": "Rowan has gone rogue, and has taken it upon himself to put the Scythedom through a trial by fire.

Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clear-sighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But given the time and the place, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy his future, and so Elwood arrives at The Nickel Academy, which claims to provide 'physical, intellectual and moral training' which will equip its inmates to become 'honorable and honest men'.In reality, the Nickel Academy is a chamber of horrors, where physical, emotional and sexual abuse is rife, where corrupt officials and tradesmen do a brisk trade in supplies intended for the school, and where any boy who resists is likely to disappear 'out back'. Stunned to find himself in this vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr King's ringing assertion, 'Throw us in jail, and we will still love you.' But Elwood's fellow inmate and new friend Turner thinks Elwood is naive and worse; the world is crooked, and the only way to survive is to emulate the cruelty and cynicism of their oppressors.The tension between Elwood's idealism and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision which will have decades-long repercussions.Based on the history of a real reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped and destroyed the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative by a great American novelist whose work is essential to understanding the current reality of the United States.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1593115396i/42270835.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Adult Fiction", "Historical", "Adult", "Race", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "African American", "Audiobook", "Novels"], "publisher": "Doubleday", "series": null, "author": ["Colson Whitehead"], "publishDate": "16-07-2019", "numOfRating": 23623, "numPages": 213, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.3, "slug": "the-nickel-boys", "totalNum": 65, "currentNum": 7, "totalBorrow": 58, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f1"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Phuong's Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62fd9"}, "title": "Defending Jacob", "description": "Award-winning author William Landay has written the consummate novel of an embattled family in crisis - a suspenseful, character-driven mystery that is also a spellbinding tale of guilt, betrayal, and the terrifying speed at which our lives can spin out of control.Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney in his suburban Massachusetts county for more than twenty years.

The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern\u2014and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees\u2014how they approach worker safety\u2014and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation\u2019s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.Habits aren\u2019t destiny.

Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other\u2019s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Kenya.We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist\u2019s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city\u2019s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life\u2014divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house\u2014and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco\u2019s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent.

A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both\u2014and escape the merciless progress of time\u2014in the transporting realms of art and music.

Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852i/49628.jpg", "genres": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literature", "Dystopia", "Historical", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "Novels"], "publisher": "Random House", "series": null, "author": ["David Mitchell"], "publishDate": "17-08-2004", "numOfRating": 21913, "numPages": 509, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4, "slug": "cloud-atlas", "totalNum": 95, "currentNum": 60, "totalBorrow": 35, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f5"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen's Books Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c62ffb"}, "title": "Before I Fall", "description": "With this stunning debut novel, New York Times bestselling author Lauren Oliver emerged as one of today's foremost authors of young adult fiction.

Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482i/11084145.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "History", "Leadership", "Autobiography", "Technology", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Memoir", "Business"], "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "series": null, "author": ["Walter Isaacson"], "publishDate": "24-10-2011", "numOfRating": 21574, "numPages": 630, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4.2, "slug": "steve-jobs", "totalNum": 46, "currentNum": 45, "totalBorrow": 1, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f2"}, "libraryName": "Books of Anh Long"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c63002"}, "title": "The Overstory", "description": "The Overstory is a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of - and paean to - the natural world.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827i/1202.jpg", "genres": ["Politics", "Social Science", "Nonfiction", "Finance", "Sociology", "Audiobook", "Science", "Economics", "Psychology", "Business"], "publisher": "William Morrow", "series": ["Freakonomics"], "author": ["Stephen J.

The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power\u2014which groups have it and which do not.\u201dIn this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people\u2019s lives and behavior and the nation\u2019s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people\u2014including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball\u2019s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others\u2014she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics.

These include emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and behaviors including argumentation and silence. In this book, DiAngelo unpacks white fragility, explaining the underlying sociological phenomena. She'll draw on examples from her work and scholarship, as well as from the culture at large, to address these fundamental questions: How does white fragility develop? What does it look like? How is it triggered?

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440763417i/40102.jpg", "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Leadership", "Philosophy", "Sociology", "Audiobook", "Science", "Personal Development", "Psychology", "Business"], "publisher": "Back Bay Books", "series": null, "author": ["Irina Henegar", "Malcolm Gladwell", "Barry Fox"], "publishDate": "03-04-2007", "numOfRating": 18584, "numPages": 296, "language": "English", "avgRating": 4, "slug": "blink-the-power-of-thinking-without-thinking", "totalNum": 50, "currentNum": 8, "totalBorrow": 42, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f5"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen's Books Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c63046"}, "title": "The Tales of Beedle the Bard", "description": "\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" contains five richly diverse fairy tales, each with its own magical character, that will variously bring delight, laughter and the thrill of mortal peril.Additional notes for each story penned by Professor Albus Dumbledore will be enjoyed by Muggles and wizards alike, as the Professor muses on the morals illuminated by the tales, and reveals snippets of information about life at Hogwarts.A uniquely magical volume, with illustrations by the author, J.

As one fireman recounted, \u201cOnce that first stack got going, it was \u2018Goodbye, Charlie.\u2019\u201d The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library\u2014and if so, who?Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present\u2014from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as \u201cThe Human Encyclopedia\u201d who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orlean\u2019s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books\u2014and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist\u2019s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1599591284i/39507318.jpg", "genres": ["Mystery", "Nonfiction", "History", "True Crime", "Adult", "Historical", "Crime", "Audiobook", "Books About Books", "Book Club"], "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "series": null, "author": ["Susan Orlean"], "publishDate": "16-10-2018", "numOfRating": 18337, "numPages": 317, "language": "English", "avgRating": 3.9, "slug": "the-library-book", "totalNum": 61, "currentNum": 3, "totalBorrow": 58, "libraryID": {"$oid": "665806e15e612a16a32d77f4"}, "libraryName": "Nguyen Anh Tu Library"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "665d46b193e6ba38b4c6304f"}, "title": "Leaving Time", "description": "For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident.
